# SimpleAlarmClock Library

Alarm Clock library that uses the real time clock of a common ZS-042 module, aka. DS3231, with a AT24c32N EEprom and CR3032 battery.

## Information

A library for the **ZS-042** module that has a **DS3231** RTC and **AT24C32** EEPROM. 

An easy set of read/write functions or methods for the DS3231 Real Time Clock and Calendar, and the companion AT24C32 EEPROM on common ZS-042 modules.  The EEPROM is used by this library to store alarm settings on registers 0x00 through 0x08 as byte values.

The remainder of the EEPROM can be used for logging or storage.

The EEPROM read and write bytes methods were copied from this Library [The AT24CX Library](https://github.com/cyberp/AT24Cx)

The intent of this library is to manage a basic alarm clock, that includes the display clock and two alarms, typically seen on standard desktop/nightstand alarm clocks.  It should accomidate switching between 12 hour and 24 modes on the fly.  Alarms have four alarm modes: Daily, Weekday, Weekend or Once.  This library assumes that alarm DOW will only be used, and alarm DATE shall not be used. The alarm modes are stored in EEPROM address 0x08.  Snooze option is available for both alarms.

This library also makes the assumption that if the year has been set to 2018 (018) or greater, the RTC clock is probably valid. This approach is used so that during a power cycle (blackout), clock settings saved by the RTC's backup battery will not be reset.
